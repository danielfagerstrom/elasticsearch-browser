elasticsearch-browser
=====================

Primitive webapp for browsing elasticsearch data.

The app can be started by installing [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/) and running:
```
$ yeoman server
```

Then the app will connect to a local ElasticSearch instance and you can browse your ElasticSearch content by pointing your browser to <http://localhost:3501/>.

The app is very simple, I mainly wrote it to learn a bit AngularJS. I have currently no plans to do any further work on it.

If you need a more usable ElasticSearch browser, take a look at [elasticsearch-head](http://mobz.github.com/elasticsearch-head/) or [elasticsearch-browser](https://github.com/OlegKunitsyn/elasticsearch-browser/wiki).
